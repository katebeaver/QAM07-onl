Validation: once user clicks outside of “Report View Name” textbox, validate displayname character count <= 256 (must be <= 255)

Radio Icon “Report Type” component with options for Firm Report / Client Report → sets Report View viewcontext (what options are supposed to be? what is the list?)

Create View” is greyed out and not clickable unless:
■ displayname is not null (must be "is null")
■ viewcontext is not null (must be "is null")
■ format is not null (must be "is null")

Upon click, attempts to create and save Report View object
■ Save Validation: upon save, validate that displayname must be unique within firm
■ If Fails validation, then display red border around text box and prevent save (I would add "and display message under the text box: Displayname must be unique", text color is red)

Save Validation: upon save, validate that displayname character count <=255
■ If Fails validation, then display red border around text box and display message: (what content, position, text color?)
